## Docker Script Documentation
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains commands that can be used from the command line to generate images. 
Like a makefile, docker build can automate a series of command line instructions. Several links have been 
provided as informational resources, and there exists a template file. The template dockerfile comes from 
https://gist.github.com/ju2wheels/3d1a1dfa498977874d03, and has a lot of useful information on what different 
components of dockerfiles do.
