# software-template

This repository is intended for use in the future as an ARFC template repository for software development.

## Licenses

This repository has a [BSD-3 license](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html), but software projects are sometimes more 
complicated than one license. If you use pieces of software that require licenses other than BSD-3, there are a couple of ways 
you can address it. One suggestion is that you create separate directories for the code. In the separate directory, you can then 
include the license that covers the code in that directory. Another suggestion is that you add all the licenses in the docs 
folder and then indicate which files or directories are covered under the respective licenses in the README.md files or in some 
other way.

There are many other ways to abide by differing licenses, these are simply suggestions about how to go about it and should not be 
taken as legal advice. Ensure that, regardless of the method you use, you are abiding by the requirements of any software you are 
using and adapting.
