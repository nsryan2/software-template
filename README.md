# software-template

This repository is intended for use in the future as an ARFC template repository for software development.

## Licenses

This repository has a [BSD-3 license](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html), but software projects are sometimes more 
complicated that requiring one license. If you use pieces of software that require multiple licenses, one suggestion is that
the you put create seperate directories for the pieces of code. In these seperate directories, you can then include the 
license that covers the code under that license. Another suggestion is that you add all the licenses in the docs folder and
then indicate which files or directories are covered under the respective licenses in the README.md files or in some other 
way.

There are many other ways to abide by differing the licenses, these are simply suggestions about how to go about it. Ensure 
that, regardless of the method you use, you are abiding by the requirements of any software you are using and adapting.
