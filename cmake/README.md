## CMake Files
CMake generates makefiles, similar Make or a makefile, except that it can also produce Ninja build files, KDEvelop or Xcode projects, and Visual Studio solutions.
One main area of CMake that is better than a regular Makefile is that it is much more compatiable with C++, and it is designed to integrate across platforms, languages, or libraries.
